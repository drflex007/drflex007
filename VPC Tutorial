A Virtual Private Cloud is a Virtual Network that closely resembles a traditional networking that you operate in your own datacenter , with the benefits of using the Saclable 
infrastruture of AWS.
OR
VPC is a Virtual Network or Data Centre inside AWS for one client.

- It is logically Isolated from other Virtual N/W in the AWS Cloud. 
- MAX 5 VPC Can be created and 200 Subnets in 1 VPC
- We Can allocate max 5 elastic IP.
- Once We Created VPC, DHCP, NACL and Security Group will be automatically Created. 
- A VPC is confined to an AWS Region and does not extend b/w regions.
- Once the VPC is created, You cannot change its CIDR Block Range.
- If you need a different CIDR size, Create a New VPC 
- The different subnets within a VPC Cannot Overlap.
- You Can however expand your VPC CIDR by adding New/Extra IP address Ranges ( Except GovCloud & AWS China )


Components Of VPC 
CIDR & IP Address Subnets
  - Implied Router & Routing Table
  - Internet Gateway
  - Security Groups
  - Network ACL
  - Virtual Private Gateway 
  - Peering Connections 
  - Elastic IP
  

VPC Types -
1. Defualt VPC 2. Custom VPC 

Defualt VPC - 
Created in Each AWS Region when an AWS Account is created. 
- Has Defualt CIDR, Security Group, NACL and Route table settings
- Has an Internet Gateway by default

Custom VPC -
Is a VPC an AWS Account Owner Creates 
- AWS User Creating the Custom VPC can decide the CIDR.
- Has its own default Security Group, Network ACL and Route Tables.
- Does not have an Internet Gateway by default, One needs to be created if Needed.


Steps to create a VPC.
1. Create a VPC.
2. Create a Subnet.
3. Create a Internet gateway.
4. Create a Route table. 


Public Subnet- if a subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet Gateway, the subnet is known as a Public Subnet. if you want ypur instance in a Public Subnet to Communicate 
with the internet over IPv4, it must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address.

Private Subnet- if a Subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway, the Subnet is known as a Private Subnet.

- When You Create a VPC, You must Specify an IPv4 CIDR Block for the VPC. The allowed block, Size is between /16 to /28 netmask.
- The first for & last IP address of subnet cannot be assigned.

10.0.0.0/16
For example - 10.0.0.0 - network address
10.0.0.1 - Reserved by AWS for the VPC Router.
10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS the IP address of DNS Server
10.0.0.3 - Reserved for future use.
10.0.0.255 - Broadcast Address.

Note - AWS do not support broadcast  in a VPC but Reversed the address.


Implied Router & Route Table 
- It is the Central Routing Function.
- It connects the different AZ together and Connects the VPC to the Internet Gateway.
- You can have upto 200 route tables per VPC.
- You can have upto 50 Routes Entries per Route Table.
- Each Subnet must be associated with only one Route Table at any Given time.
- If you do not Specify a Subnet will be associated with the default VPC Route Table.
- You can also edit the main route table if you need, but you cannot delete main route table.
- However you can make a custom route table manually become the main route table then you can delete the former main, as it it no longer main route table.
- You can associate multiple subnets with the same route table.
