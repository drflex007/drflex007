A Virtual Private Cloud is a Virtual Network that closely resembles a traditional networking that you operate in your own datacenter , with the benefits of using the Saclable 
infrastruture of AWS.
OR
VPC is a Virtual Network or Data Centre inside AWS for one client.

- It is logically Isolated from other Virtual N/W in the AWS Cloud. 
- MAX 5 VPC Can be created and 200 Subnets in 1 VPC
- We Can allocate max 5 elastic IP.
- Once We Created VPC, DHCP, NACL and Security Group will be automatically Created. 
- A VPC is confined to an AWS Region and does not extend b/w regions.
- Once the VPC is created, You cannot change its CIDR Block Range.
- If you need a different CIDR size, Create a New VPC 
- The different subnets within a VPC Cannot Overlap.
- You Can however expand your VPC CIDR by adding New/Extra IP address Ranges ( Except GovCloud & AWS China )


Components Of VPC 
CIDR & IP Address Subnets
  - Implied Router & Routing Table
  - Internet Gateway
  - Security Groups
  - Network ACL
  - Virtual Private Gateway 
  - Peering Connections 
  - Elastic IP
  

VPC Types -
1. Defualt VPC 2. Custom VPC 

Defualt VPC - 
Created in Each AWS Region when an AWS Account is created. 
- Has Defualt CIDR, Security Group, NACL and Route table settings
- Has an Internet Gateway by default

Custom VPC -
Is a VPC an AWS Account Owner Creates 
- AWS User Creating the Custom VPC can decide the CIDR.
- Has its own default Security Group, Network ACL and Route Tables.
- Does not have an Internet Gateway by default, One needs to be created if Needed.


Steps to create a VPC.
1. Create a VPC.
2. Create a Subnet.
3. Create a Internet gateway.
4. Create a Route table. 


Public Subnet- if a subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet Gateway, the subnet is known as a Public Subnet. if you want ypur instance in a Public Subnet to Communicate 
with the internet over IPv4, it must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address.

Private Subnet- if a Subnet does not have a route to the internet gateway, the Subnet is known as a Private Subnet.

- When You Create a VPC, You must Specify an IPv4 CIDR Block for the VPC. The allowed block, Size is between /16 to /28 netmask.
- The first for & last IP address of subnet cannot be assigned.

10.0.0.0/16
For example - 10.0.0.0 - network address
10.0.0.1 - Reserved by AWS for the VPC Router.
10.0.0.2 - Reserved by AWS the IP address of DNS Server
10.0.0.3 - Reserved for future use.
10.0.0.255 - Broadcast Address.

Note - AWS do not support broadcast  in a VPC but Reversed the address.


Implied Router & Route Table 
- It is the Central Routing Function.
- It connects the different AZ together and Connects the VPC to the Internet Gateway.
- You can have upto 200 route tables per VPC.
- You can have upto 50 Routes Entries per Route Table.
- Each Subnet must be associated with only one Route Table at any Given time.
- If you do not Specify a Subnet will be associated with the default VPC Route Table.
- You can also edit the main route table if you need, but you cannot delete main route table.
- However you can make a custom route table manually become the main route table then you can delete the former main, as it it no longer main route table.
- You can associate multiple subnets with the same route table. 


Internet Gateway 
- An Internet Gateway is a Virtual Router that connects a VPC to the internet.
- Defualt VPC is already attached with an Internet Gateway.
- If you Create a new VPC then you must attach the Internet Gateway in order to access the Internet.
- Ensure that your Subnet's Route table points to the internet Gateway.
- It performs NAT b/w your private and public IPv4 address.
- It's supports both IPv4 and IPv6.


Nat Gateways - (PAT - Port Address Translation)
You can use a newtwork address translation gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS Services, But prevent the internet from
intiating a connection with these instances.

--> You are charged for creating and using a NAT Gatway in your account. NAT Gatway hourly usage and data processing rates apply Amazon EC2 Charges for data transfer also apply.
--> To Create a NAT Gateway, You must specify the public subnet in which the NAT Gateway should reside. 
--> You must also specify an Elastic IP address to associate with NAT Gateway when you create it.
--> No need to assign public IP address to your Private instance.
--> After you have created a NAT Gateway you must update the Route Table associated with one or more of your Private Subnets to point Internet Bound traffic to the NAT 
Gateway. This enables instances in your private Subnet to Communicate with the internet. 
--> Deleting a NAT Gateway, disassociates its Elastic IP Address, but does not release the address from your account. so release the elastic ip address to not get extra charges 
in your account. 


Security Groups -
-- > It is a virtual firewall works at ENI( Elastic Network Interface) level.
-- > upto 5 security groups per EC2 instance interface can be applied.
-- > Can Only have permit Rules, Can not have deny rule.
-- > Stateful , Return traffic , of allowed inbound traffic is allowed , even if there are no rules to allow it. 

Network ACL -

-- > It is function performed on the Implied Router. 
-- > NACL is on Optional Layer of Security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and Out of One or more Subnets.
-- > Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default Network ACL by default it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and if applicable, IPv6 traffic.
-- > You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a Subnet by default, each Custom Network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. 
-- > Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a Network ACL if you don't explicitly associate a Subnet with a Network ACL, the Subnet is automatically associated 
with the Defualt Network ACL.
-- > You can associate a Network ACL with multiple Subnet, however a Subnet can be associated with Only One network ACL at a time when you associate a Network ACL with 
a Subnet, the previous association is removed. 
-- > A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that we evaluate in Order, Starting with the lowest numbered Rule. 
-- > the highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766 recommeded that you start by creating rules with rule number that a multiple of 100, So that you can insert new 
rules where you need later.
-- > it functions at subnet level.
-- > NACl are stateless, Outbound traffic for an allowed inbound traffic must be explicitly allowed too.
-- > You can have permit and deny Rules in a NACL. 

Difference in Security Groups and NACL.
1. Security groups operated at instance level  and NACL operates at the Subnet Level. 
2. Security Groups support allows rules only. and NACL permits allow as well as Deny rules.
3. Security Groups are stateful, return traffic is automatically allowed and NACL stateless, return traffic must be explicitly allowed by Rules.
4. Security Groups applies to an instance only and NACL applies to all instances in the subnet. 


VPC Peering. 

A VPC peering connection is a Networking connection b/w two VPC that enables you to route traffic b/w them using private IPv4 address or IPv6 addresses. 

-- > Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
-- > You can create a VPC Peering Connection b/w your own VPC or with a VPC in another AWS Account the VPC can be in differnet Region. 


Transitive peering is possiable in AWS - no it is not possiable.
Transitive peering means can instance in VPC A communicate to instance in VPC C throungh VPC B.

VPC A --> VPC Peering --> VPC B --> VPC Peering --> VPC C
