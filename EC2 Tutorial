Amazon EC2 provides sclable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. 
You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need. 
Configure Security and networking and manage storage.
Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or scale down the instance. 
Amazon EC2 is having two storage options i.e. EBS  & instance store.
Pre Configured Templates are available Known as Amazon Machine Image.
By Defualt, When you create on EC2 instance Account with amazon. Your account is limited to a maximum of 20 instances per EC2 Region with two defualt High I/O instances.

Types of EC2 Instances -
Genreal Purpose - Balnaced memmory & CPU 
Computed Optimized - More CPU than RAM 
Storage Optimized - More RAM
Accelerated Computing / GPU - Graphic Optimized 
High Memory - Low latency 
High Memory Optimized - High RAM , Nitro System ( a kind of specific hypervisor ) 

General Purpose Instance
General purpose instances provides  a Balance of Compute, Memory and Networking Resources and can be used variety of workloads.

3 Series of general purpose 
A Series ( Medium, Large ) - A1 
M Series ( Large ) - M4, M5 , M5a , M5a, M5d
T Series  - T2 ( t2.micro - free tier eligiable ), T3 , T3a 

Instances available in Fours Sizes - nano , small , medium , large

A1 - Instances 
A1 - instances are ideally suited for scale-out workloads that are supported by the ARM Eco System 

These instaces are well-suited for the following application
1. Webserver
2. Containerized micro services 
3. caching fleets ( High-Speed data storage layer , its kind of caching data that gonna use frequentally)
4. Distributed data stores 
5. Application that requires ARM Instruction Set

M4, M5 , (M5ad and M5d) recentally added.

M4 instance
The new MY instances fetures a Custom Intel Xeon E5 - 2676 V3 Haswell processor Optimized Specifically for EC2.
VCPU - 2 to 40 ( Max )
RAM - 8 GB to 160 GB ( Max )
Instance Storage - EBS only ( Root Voloume )

M5, M5a , M5ad and M5d Instances - These instances provide an ideal cloud infra , offering a Balance of compute , memory and Networking Resources for a Broad ranges of 
applications.
Used In - Gaming Server, Web Server, Small and Medium Databases 
VCPU - 2 to 96 ( Max )
RAM - 8 to 384 ( Max)
Instance storage - EBS & NVMe SSD

T2 , T3 and T3a Instances 
These instances provide a baseline level of CPU performance (5 % to 40 %) with the ability to burst to a higher level when Required by your Workload.
An unlimited instances can sustain high CPU performace for any period of time whenever required. 
VCPU - 2 to 8
RAM - 0.5 to 32 GB

Used in- 
1. Website and Webapp 
2. Code Repositories 
3. Development , Build and Test 
4. Microservices
