Types of Storage-
1. Simple Storage Service (S3)
2. Elastic File System (EFS)
3. Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
4. Glacier 
5. Snowball

AWS offer a  Complete Range of Cloud Storage Services to Support both application and archival Compliance requirements select from Objects, File and Block Storage Services as 
well as cloud data Migration options to start desiging the foundation of Your Cloud IT Enviornment.

Block Storage 
-- > Block Storage is suitable for transactional databases, random read/write loads and structured databases storage.
-- > Block Storage divides the data to be stored in evenly sized blocks ( data chunk ) for instance, a file can be split into evenly sized blocks before it is stored. 
-- > Data Blocks stored in  block storage would not contain Metadata (data created, data modified, content type etc.)
-- > Block Storage only keeps the address ( index ) where the data blocks are stored. it does not care what is in that block, just how to retrieve it when required.

Object Storage 
---> Object Storage stores the files as a whole and does not divide them. 
---> In object storage, an object is 
    -- > The file/data itself 
    -- > Its metadata
    -- > Object Global Unique ID

---> The Object Global Unique ID, is a Unique Identifier for the Object ( Can be the object name itself )  and it must be unique such that it can be retrieved disregarding 
where its physical storage location is. 
--- > object storage can not be mounted as a Drive. 
Example of Object Storage Solutions - Dropbox , AWS S3, Facebook. 

Simple Storage Service ( S3 )

---> S3 is a storage for the internet. It has a simple webservices interface for simple storing & retrieving of any amount of data. anytime from anywhere on the internet. 
---> S3 is object based storage.
---> You camnot install Operating System on S3.
---> S3 has a distributed data-store architecture where objects are redundantly stored in  Mulitple Locations ( Min 3 Location in Same Region )
---> Data is stored in Bucket.
---> A Bucket is a flat container of objects.
---> Max Capacity of a Bucket is 5 TB. 
---> You can create folders in your Bucket ( available through Console )
---> You cannot created Nested Buckets. 
---> Bucket Ownership is Non-transferrable. 
---> S3 Bucket is Region Specific.
---> You can have upto 100 Buckets per account ( May expand on Request )

You can access S3 bucket through https or http protocol. 

S3 Buckets- Naming Rules
---> S3 Bucket names (Keys) are globally unique across all AWS Regions.
---> Bucket Names Cannot be change after they are created.
---> If a bucket is deleted, its name becomes available again to you or other account to use. 
---> Bucket names must be atleast 3 and no more than 63 charcters long. 
---> Bucket names are part of the URL used to access a Bucket. 
---> Bucket name must be a series of one or more labels ( XYZ Bucket). 
---> Bucket names can contain lowercase, nummbers and hyphen cannot use uppercase letter. 
---> Bucket name should not be an IP address (10.0.0.20) 
---> Each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number. 
---> By Default, buckets and its objects one private By Default, only owner can access the bucket. 

S3 Buckets - Subresouces

Sub-resources of S3 bucket includes -
Lifecycle - To decide on objects Lifecycles Management. 
Website - To hold configrations related to static Website hosted in S3 Buckets.
Versioning - Keep Object versions as its changes ( Gets updated ) ( can be enable and suspend but can not be disabled )
Access Control List - Bucket Policies. 


The name is simply two parts - BucketRegion's endpoint/bucketname
Example - for S3 bucket named mybucket in Europe West Region.
https://s3-eu-west1.amazonaws.com/mybucket

S3 Objects -
An object size stored in an S3 bucket can be 0 byte  to 5 TB. 
--->  Each object is stored and retrieved by a unique key ( ID or Name ) 
---> An Object in AWS S3 is uniquely identified and addressed through
    ---> Service Endpoint 
    ---> Bucket Name
    ---> Object Key ( Name )
    ---> Optionally Object Version

---> Object stored in a S3-bucket in a Region will never leave that Region unless you specifically move them to another region or CRR(Cross Region Replication).
---> A Bucket Owner Can grant cross-account permissions to another AWS account ( Or users in another account ) to Upload Objects.
---> You can grant S3 bucket/ object permission to -
     ---> Individual Users 
     ---> AWS Account 
     ---> Make the Resounce Public 
     ---> or to all authenticate User. 
     
     
S3 Bucket Versioning -

---> Bucket Versioning is a S3 Bucket Sub-resouce used to protect against accidental Object/Data deletion or Overwrites.
---> Versioning Can also be used for data retention and archive.
---> Once you enable versioning on a Bucket, it cannot be disabled, however it can be suspended. 
---> When enabled , Bucket Versioning will protect existing and new objects, and maintains thier Versions as they are Updated.
---> Updating Objects refers to PUT, POST, COPY, DELETE actions on objects. 
---> When Versioning is enabled and you try to delete an object, a delete Marker is placed on the object. 
    ---> You can still view the object and the delete Marker.
---> If you reconsider deleting the objects, you can delete the " Delete Marker "  and the object will be available again. 
---> You will be charged foe all S3 storage cost for all object versions stored. 
---> Yon can use versioning with S3 Lifecycle Policies to delete older Versions, Or You can move them to a Cheaper S3 Storage ( or Glacier ) 
     Bucket Versioning State- 
       -- Enabled 
       -- Suspended 
       -- Un-Versioned ( until when you not enabled versioning )
 ---> Versioning applies to all Objects in a bucket and not partially applied.
 ---> Object Existing before enabling Versioning will have a Version ID or " Null" 
 ---> If you have a bucket that is already Versioned, then you Suspend Versioning. existing Objects and thier Versions remain as it is. 
     ---> However they will not be Updated/Versioned Further with future updates while the bucket Versioning is suspended.
 ---> New Objects ( Uploaded after Suspension ) they will have a Version ID "Null".if the same key (name) is used to store another objects, it will override the existing one. 
 ---> An Object deletion in a Suspended Versioning Buckets, will only delete the objects with ID " Null ".
 
 
 S3 Bucket Versioning - MFA Delete
 
 ---> Multifactor authentication delete is a Versioning Capacity that adds another level of Security in case your account is compromised.
 --> This adds another layer of security for the follwing -
    --> Changing you Bucket Versoning State. 
    --> Permanently deleting an Object  Version.
MFA Delete Requires - 
---> Your Security Credentials 
---> The Code displayed on an approved physical or S/W based authentication device.


S3 Multipart Upload
---> Is used to upload an object in parts. 
---> Part are uploded indepently and in parallel, in any order. 
---> It is recommended for objects sizes of 100 MB or larger. 
---> You must use it for objects Larger than 5 GB.
---> This is done through S3 Multipart Upload API.

Coping S3 Objects 
---> The Copy Operations Creates a Copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.
---> You can create a copy of your object upto 5 GB in size in a Single atomic operation. 
---> However to copy an object greater than 5 GB, You must use the multipart upload API.
---> Incur Charges, if copy to another region. 

Use the copy operation to - 
---> Generate addtional copies of the Subject. 
---> Renaming Object ( Copy to a new name )
---> Changing the Copy's storage class or encrypt it at rest.
---> Move object across AWS location Region. 
---> Change object Metadata.
