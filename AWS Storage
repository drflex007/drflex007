Block Storage 
-- > Block Storage is suitable for transactional databases, random read/write loads and structured databases storage.
-- > Block Storage divides the data to be stored in evenly sized blocks ( data chunk ) for instance, a file can be split into evenly sized blocks before it is stored. 
-- > Data Blocks stored in  block storage would not contain Metadata (data created, data modified, content type etc.)
-- > Block Storage only keeps the address ( index ) where the data blocks are stored. it does not care what is in that block, just how to retrieve it when required.

Object Storage 
---> Object Storage stores the files as a whole and does not divide them. 
---> In object storage, an object is 
    -- > The file/data itself 
    -- > Its metadata
    -- > Object Global Unique ID

---> The Object Global Unique ID, is a Unique Identifier for the Object ( Can be the object name itself )  and it must be unique such that it can be retrieved disregarding where 
its physical storage location is. 
--- > object storage can not be mounted as a Drive.
